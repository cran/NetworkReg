Description: Linear regression model with nonparametric network effects on network-linked observations. The model is proposed by Le and Li (2022) <arXiv:2007.00803> and is assumed on observations that are connected by a network or similar relational data structure. The model does not assume that the relational data or network structure to be precisely observed; thus, the method is provably robust to a certain level of perturbation of the network structure. The package contains the estimation and inference function for the model.
